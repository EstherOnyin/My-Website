                One of the things I enjoy doing is creating innovative solutions using data
                to solve issues that plague society. I love thinking about issues like 
                global warming, global hunger, homelessness, and poverty, and different 
                scenario that these issues could be solved. Therefore, in order to one day 
                be part of the team that helps put an end to this issue, I decided to 
                study an intriguing course at Nova Scotia Community College.<br><br><br><br>
    
            
                My name is Esther Obieme. I am an African Nova Scotia Student studying IT Database 
                Administration at Nova Scotia Community College. I have recently completed my first
                year for this course, and patiently waiting for my second and last year studying 
                Database Administration.<br><br>
            
                Data is an ideology that exists everywhere. It is used to make predictions about 
                the possible future, the impact the future would have on humanity and society, and 
                how to counter them effectively.<br><br>
            
                Data has changed and is still changing the world at a rapid paste. My goal is 
                to learn how to collect, store, and manipulate data in order to be prepared to 
                solve uprising issues.</p>
